# HEAT - VIII - (SIMPLIFIED) HEAT TAGS.md

## 1. **ALL "{SIMP}" ACT AS A SECOND MORE USER FRIENDLY HEAT TAG REFERENCE/TITLE. INCASE YOU FORGET SOME SHORT FORMS ON THE FLY INITITATE**

> "SHORT EXPLANATION OF TAG"; 'EXAMPLE'.
> [ACCR] = '{EXM}'
> {ht} = 'exm'

1. > This command is used to initiate functions in the chain prompting to the ai. An easy way to activate new forks in prompting, reminding the ai to adhere to a certain protocol, or automated prompting to another function. This is an optimized way to fork multiple changes in the chain prompting. it would be used after the ~HEAT codetag prompt, and before another code tag function. for example;

2. > ~HEAT .injkT 'exm' OR 'example' "
